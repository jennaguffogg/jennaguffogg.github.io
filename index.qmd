Hi there ðŸ‘‹ I'm **Jenna**!

I'm a remote sensing data scientist who uses satellites, geospatial data and cloud computing to tackle large-scale environmental challenges. In the past I have worked on projects that tracked logging events across state forests over 30+ years and more recently, my PhD research involved looking for marine plastic pollution on remote beaches. You can read more about my work on finding plastic pollution with satellites [**here**](https://www.rmit.edu.au/news/media-releases-and-expert-comments/2022/feb/beach-plastics).

I'm an advocate for science communication, and have given public talks at [**government workshops**](https://www.mima.gov.my/event/malaysia-australia-dialogue-series-on-combating-marine-plastic-pollution-2-2022) and as part of [**National Science Week**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Td0HOQgQ4O4&ab_channel=STEMSisters).
