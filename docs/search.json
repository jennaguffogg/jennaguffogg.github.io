In the past I have worked on projects that tracked logging events across state forests over 30+ years and more recently, my PhD research involved looking for marine plastic pollution on remote beaches. You can read more about my work on finding plastic pollution with satellites here.\nIâ€™m an advocate for science communication, and have given public talks at government workshops and as part of National Science Week."
